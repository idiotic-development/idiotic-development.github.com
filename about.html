	<p>In Jr high there was a website that didn't exist I wanted to use, so I did the logical thing, I made it. I quickly became irritated with the limitations of the WYSIWYG editor I was using and decided to learn html css. Over the next couple years I buried myself in html and css then moved on to javascript and php. I started experimenting with java toward the beginning of high school. I was originally learning java too create apps for the web, but I soon discovered I enjoyed the complexity and structurer of full software development. At some point I started using linux exclusively and was drawn in to using bash then zsh. Since then I have worked with c/c++, python, and ruby among others. This past year I have been exploring mobile app development, more info on the development page. I am currently pursuing a bachelor's in computer science</p>
