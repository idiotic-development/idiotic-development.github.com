Hi! I'm Timothy Johnson.  
\\
There's a lot of things I could say here; I could list my achievements, I could spout some cheesy line such as, *'Customer satisfaction is my top priority'*, or I could flat out lie, whatever it takes to get the job, right? Every developer out there has an impressive-sounding introduction, but really it's meaningless&mdash;just noise. I'm not going to do that. I'm Timothy Johnson, I'm just a guy. A guy who has invested a lot of time and hard work into becoming a developer. So, what can I do for you?  
\\
Primarily I perform the following.  

* Web design, including css3 and html5
* Android app development
* Desktop application development

However, I have gathered a diverse skill set allowing me go beyond the typical when required.
