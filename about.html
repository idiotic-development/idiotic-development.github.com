<p>Hi! I’m Timothy Johnson.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of things I could say here, I could list my achievements, I could spout some cheesy line such as <em>‘Customer satisfaction is my top priority’</em>, I could flat out lie, whatever it takes to get the job right? Every developer out there has an impressive sounding introduction, but really it’s meaningless, just noise. I’m not going to do that. I’m Timothy Johnson, I’m just a guy. A guy who has invested a lot of time and hard work into becoming a developer.</p>

<p>Primarily I preform the following.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Web design including css3 and html5</li>
  <li>Android app development</li>
  <li>Desktop application development</li>
</ul>

<p>But I have gathered a diverse skill set and would be happy to help you with whatever you need.</p>
